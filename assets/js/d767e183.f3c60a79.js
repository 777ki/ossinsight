Regardless of Github insights, you might encounter similar problems in your daily work. For example, if you are building a operational gaming data service system, you might face the customer inquery request: "I just looted the sword of infinity, but I can\'t find it in my backpack now!" You need to quickly locate the loot data of that unlucky player from large volume of records to get a clue of the situation. Did he accidentally destroyed the sword? Is it ninjaed? Does the bored player simply want a chat with GMs?

Scaling the cluster as well as desining the partition key takes you a lot of effort. Moreover, for analytical services , you might need to deploy a dedicated analytical database in addition, and take care of the real-time ETL pipeline.

Consider quering for an individual organization: if it is a small organization with three or five people, the Github events since its creation may not exceed 10,000; while for giants like Microsoft and Alibaba, the difference on data volume is in orders of magnitude.
